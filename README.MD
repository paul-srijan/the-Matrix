## 🎮 Customisation Options

You can control the following settings through the on-screen panel:

| Option        | Description                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Characters** | Define the set of characters used in the rain. |
| **Speed**      | Adjust the rain's speed (1 to 100).       |
| **Color**      | Change the colour of the falling characters.|

## ✨ How It Works
1. **Canvas Animation**: The animation is drawn on an HTML `<canvas>` element.
2. **Dynamic Characters**: Each column independently drops random characters.
3. **Mouse Interaction**:
   - **Click**: Generate ripple effects.
   - **Move**: Clear specific columns of characters dynamically.
